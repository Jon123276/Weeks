# Week one goal
## Schedule throughout.

### Week One
```
    Project 1: 70% -> 85%
    ```
        Started fixing milestones 1-3, ending up at 3 this week with a problem of the operator* method.
    ```
    Project 2: 80% -> 95%
    ```
        Started going though each of the milestones, ending up at milestone 4 this week. The current problem is the String(int, const char[]) constructor.
    ```
    Project 3: 50% -> 25%
    ```
        After not knowing what to do during the project, I decided to restart the project, as I will need to understand pointers more. I have finished milestone 1, and milestone 2 will be easy.
    ```
```
